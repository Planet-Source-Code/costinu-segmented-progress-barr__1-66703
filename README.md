### Description

The purpose of this progress bar is to show progress segmented. Can be used when you have many jobs which have different sizes and values. Can be used like a common progress bar when you have one segment.

I post this code because I didn&#8217;t find this kind of bar on 1VBStreet and also because in that way I can see somebody else opinion. Is a beta version.

I made an extra example using Sgrid 2.0 from vbaccelerator.

Comments are welcome, votes not necessary.
